## Background and Objectives 
Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) incidence is rising among the elderly, yet the impact of age on recovery remains controversial. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of age on neurological and functional outcomes and to identify an age cut-off associated with a decline in recovery.

## Methods 
We conducted a prospective cohort study using the data from patients with traumatic and ischemic SCI enrolled in the European Multicenter Study about SCI between 2001 and 2022. Linear regression models assessed the effect of age on changes from baseline to 1 year after SCI in total motor score (TMS) of the International Standards for Neurological Classification of SCI (ISNCSCI) and in the Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM) total score. Additional analyses examined the effect of age on the evolution of ISNCSCI light touch and pin prick scores, as well as ambulation parameters. Models were adjusted for baseline scores, sex, year of injury, AIS grade, and level of injury. The age cut-off was determined using a change-point model.

## Results 
A total of 2,171 patients (median age: 47 years; 77.9% male) were included in the analysis. Age was not associated with changes in TMS (p = 0.896) but was significantly associated with reduced SCIM improvement (p < 0.001), with an estimated decline of 4.3 SCIM points per decade. Sensory outcomes were not significantly affected by age (Œî light touch: p = 0.273; Œî pinprick: p = 0.520), while ambulation recovery declined with increasing age (all outcomes p < 0.01). A noticeable reduction in functional recovery was observed in patients older than 70 years.

## Discussion 
Older age does not appear to impact neurological recovery but is linked to poorer functional and ambulation outcomes. These findings, including the identified age cut-off, should inform future clinical trial design and guide tailored care strategies for older adults with traumatic SCI.
